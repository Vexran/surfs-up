### Project Overview
This analysis project requires a quick information on the weather of hawaii.

This analysis aims to help W. Avy, a famous surfer, and investor, make critical business decisions about opening an ice cream shop with surf gear called "Surf n' Shake Shop" on the island of Oahu. The location is essential because climate can change. W. Ivy wants to be prepared by studying and learning the weather history and patterns in the area where the shop might be located. A perfect place for the shop is where there is the right balance of warm temperatures and sunny days throughout the year. The data-driven decisions that we will make will be based on temperature for the past 7 years from 2010-2017, specifically June and December. These 2 months are far apart enough to ensure we have excellent conditions year-round.

### Results
The analysis focuses on the temperature from six different weather stations. On Oahu, Hawaii, from 2010-2017 and June and December, specifically.
The first 2 charts show the statistics for June and December
